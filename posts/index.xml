      <description>After a few years of shooting with the X-T20, I&amp;rsquo;ve swapped up to the X-Pro3.
For my first outing with this camera, of course I chose Pike Place Market. It&amp;rsquo;s surely the easiest place in Seattle to be a street photographer. People are comfortable, having fun, and cameras are everywhere.
 I haven&amp;rsquo;t shot around Pike Place Market in a long time; even before the pandemic, I&amp;rsquo;d walked up and down that market so many times that it was starting to become too familiar.</description>

      <description>Step 1: The spark ignites Oooh, look at this cool person&amp;rsquo;s blog post that was posted on Hacker News&amp;hellip; Why don&amp;rsquo;t I have cool, minimal blog like this?
Step 2: Pick your theme Spend two hours browsing minimal Hugo themes until you find one that&amp;rsquo;s simple yet functional.
Step 3: Simplify Why does this &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; theme include google analytics, disqus, and javascript auto day/night theme detection?
I should gut it of all the stuff I don&amp;rsquo;t need&amp;hellip;</description>
